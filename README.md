**Decoding Tech Trends: A Five-Year Analysis of Stack Overflow's Developer Surveys**

Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey collects data from developers worldwide, focusing on various aspects like programming languages, tools, technologies, work preferences, employment status, and demographics. It aims to understand trends in the tech industry, developer experiences, and challenges. The survey results provide insights into the current state of software development, popular technologies, career satisfaction, and the diversity of the developer community. 

This project dives into the last 5 years of these surveys. This data will be my primary data source for this project.
